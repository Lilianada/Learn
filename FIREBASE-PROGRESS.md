# Firebase Integration Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Type Fixes**
   - Updated types in `types/store-types.ts` to include missing properties like order, status, and completionPercentage
   - Fixed return types in Firebase service functions for consistency
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in `firebase.ts`, `firebase-service.ts`, and `auth-context.tsx`
   - Fixed null checks for `topic.subtopicOrder` in both `use-store.ts` and `sidebar.tsx`

2. **Firebase Service Functions**
   - Added `reorderTopics` and `reorderSubtopics` functions to firebase-service.ts
   - Updated user preferences handling to match our application's types
   - Fixed the `deleteSubjectFiles` function call in store implementations
   - Added proper type assertions for Firebase instances

3. **Component Updates**
   - Fixed the `ClientFirebaseInit` component for SSR compatibility
   - Corrected the `firebase-init.tsx` file to use the proper store
   - Updated the FirebaseInit component to set useFirebase flag properly
   - Added the `firebaseEnabled` flag to track Firebase availability in components
   - Updated `MainContent`, `Header`, `Sidebar`, and other components to use the correct store

4. **Store Integration**
   - Updated the `reorderTopics` function in the Firebase store
   - Enhanced the StoreInitializer to work with both Firebase and local storage
   - Added proper state management for Firebase mode
   - Improved Firebase initialization with better error handling

5. **Configuration and Error Handling**
   - Added detailed validation for Firebase configuration values
   - Added proper fallback behavior when Firebase isn't configured
   - Created a complete `.env.local` file with Firebase configuration values
   - Enhanced error reporting for Firebase services

## Current Status

All TypeScript errors have been fixed, and the application now properly handles Firebase availability, with graceful fallback to local storage when Firebase is not configured or unavailable.

## Latest Updates (May 12, 2025)

1. **Authentication UI Improvements**
   - Added a visible sign-in/sign-out button in the header component
   - Button changes based on authentication state (Sign In when logged out, Sign Out when logged in)
   - Improved responsive design with icon-only display on smaller screens
   
2. **Authentication Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error handling for `redirect_uri_mismatch` errors
   - Added specific error messages and alerts for common authentication issues
   - Improved error reporting with detailed console logs
   
3. **Firebase Debugging Tools**
   - Updated `firebase-debug.ts` with new diagnostic functions
   - Added `diagnoseRedirectUriIssue()` helper function to troubleshoot redirect URI problems
   - Enhanced `testSignIn()` function with better error reporting
   - Made debugging tools available in browser console for easier troubleshooting

4. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Removed explicit `redirect_uri` setting from GoogleProvider to avoid redirect URI issues
   - Updated authentication flow to use the Firebase console configuration
   - Added better error messages and alerts for authentication failures

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the application with proper Firebase credentials
   - Verify admin authentication works correctly
   - Test adding/editing/deleting subjects, topics, and subtopics
   - Test the application with and without Firebase configuration

2. **Future Improvements**
   - Implement data migration between local storage and Firebase
   - Consider implementing offline support with local-first approach
   - Verify that user preferences are correctly synchronized

3. **Component Integration**
   - Ensure all UI components are properly connected to the Firebase store
   - Test that data changes reflect immediately in the UI

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider adding caching mechanisms for Firebase data
   - Optimize data fetching to reduce Firebase reads
